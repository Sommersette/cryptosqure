# _CryptoSquare_

#### _A simple JavaScript driven program to encode a message using the CryptoSquare method from antiquity., 30-03-2017_

#### By _**Aubrey Masten & Trevor Fast**_

## Description

_This program allows a user to enter any a string of coherent characters and then encode it. This is done by using a keyboard and a mouse via an internet browser._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* In your desired directory enter the command:
* `git clone https://github.com/Sommersette/cryptosquare`


## Expected Behaviour/Specs
  1. take input string from text box and remove all non-alphanumerical characters including spaces.
  2. changes all characters to lowercase
  3. separate from string to individual characters.
  4. counts the characters
  5. calculates the number of arrays needed to fit the strings into
  6. loops through character string and adds blocks of characters of a calculated length to the cryptosquare array
  7. views the array at the 0 index and goes through all arrays at 0 index and then creates a string of blocks 5 characters long.
  8. then views each array at index of 1 and concats index 0 remaining characters with beginning of index 1
  9. creates blocks of text in a string 5 characters long
  10. then index of 2 is concat with 1 and so on from left to right until reaching the final index location of each array and creating strings containing blocks 5 characters and outputs them to the DOM.
